# Formizee API

## Project Structure
```
  @formizee/api 
  ╰ src
    │ lib           <-- Utility libraries
    │ v1            <-- Each version has it's own directory
    ╰  index.ts    <-- API entry point
```

## Testing

We provide integration testing for the API,
as it is the main core of our product.

1. Setup your local enviroment running `pnpm local` on the root directory.
2. In order to run the `test` command you need a instance of the api running in the background.
