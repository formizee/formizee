        Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your

        concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends
        list, and profile picture, as well as other information you choose to

      <p>
        If you are a resident in the European Economic Area (EEA), United
        Kingdom (UK), or Switzerland, then these countries may not necessarily
        have data protection laws or other similar laws as comprehensive as
        those in your country. However, we will take all necessary measures to

        Clauses for transfers of personal information between our group
        companies and between us and our third-party providers.

        We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is
        necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a
        longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,

      </p>
      <p>
        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
        personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such
        information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your
        personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will
        securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further
        processing until deletion is possible.

        We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and
        organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any
        personal information we process.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information,
        no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage
        technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or
        guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third
        parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect,
        access, steal, or modify your information.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although we will do our best to protect your personal information,
        transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your
        own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure
        environment.

      <p>
        We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18
        years of age. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least
        18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to
        such minor dependent&rsquo;s use of the Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of
        age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take
        reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If
        you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under
        age 18, please contact us at support@formizee.com.

        from a legal obligation, or any processing that may be required to
        protect against illegal activities.

      <p>
        Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to
        determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in
        our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide
        information so that we can match it with information you have previously
        provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit,
        we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the
        information you provide with the information we already have on file, or
        we may contact you through a communication method (e.g., phone or email)
        that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other
        verification methods as the circumstances dictate.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify
        your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible,
        we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the
        purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your identity
        from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you
        provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your
        identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete
        such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying
        you.
