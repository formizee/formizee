title: Authentication

In your Settings, you can create and later revoke your API token. Once created,
it will be shown only once so keep it safe.

On every request to `https://api.formizee.com/v1`, you'll have to attach the
token to the header.

```ts
const endpoints = await fetch(`https://api.formizee.com/v1/endpoints`, {
  method: "GET",
  headers: new Headers({
    "Authorization": "fz_123456789",
  }),
});
```

Use the above snippet to try it out.

We currently do not have an SDK to make the best out of it. Any contributions
are welcome.
