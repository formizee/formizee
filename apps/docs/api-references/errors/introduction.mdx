The Formizee API returns machine readable error codes to quickly identify the type of error as well as link to the docs.


```json
{
  error: {
    code: "UNAUTHORIZED",
    message: "Please login in order to perform this action",
    docs: "https://formizee.com/docs/api-references/errors/code/UNAUTHORIZED",
  }
}

```
