We use [vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for our unit and integration tests. You can run the tests with:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm test
```

## API Tests

`/apps/api` is our core product and needs to be heavily tested. we use integration testing:

  ```bash
  pnpm test --filter @formizee/api
  ```

<Info>
Integration tests require a running API either locally or in a deployed environment.
