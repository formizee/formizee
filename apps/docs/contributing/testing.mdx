We use [vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for our unit and integration tests. You can run the tests with:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm test
```

## Integration Tests

`/apps/api` and `/apps/vault` is our core product and needs to be heavily tested. we use integration testing:

  ```bash
  pnpm test --filter api
  pnpm test --filter vault
  ```

<Info>
Integration tests require a running `API` or `Vault` either locally or in a deployed environment.
