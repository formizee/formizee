## A Redesigned Forms Backend Platform
Formizee was built because I’m passionate about open source and the beauty of software crafted with care.

To me, web forms are such a common need that they should be simple, affordable, and powered by modern, reliable technology—not left behind on outdated servers.

That’s why I’ve poured so much energy into making Formizee innovative, fast, and full of thoughtful features.
